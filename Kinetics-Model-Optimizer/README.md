# Crude Oil Combustion Kinetics Parameter Matching

Matching parameters in a kinetics model to experimental data is one of the foremost challenges in studying in-situ combustion. In this folder, we provide code to perform the kinetics matching, and uncertainty quantification on the matched parameters. 


## Previous Work

Much of this workflow is based on the code for "An Optimization Algorithm for Evaluation of Kinetic Parameters for Crude Oil Combustion" (2018). This algorithm was developed primarily by Kuy Hun Koh Yoo, and the implementation was in MATLAB and CMG Stars. For this project, we've converted all code to be in Python and written simulators with the goal of developing an open-source parameter optimization code. 

## Release Notes

This project is currently in development. We present all code "AS IS" and "WITH ALL FAULTS". When this project approaches completition, we will provide more extensive documentation for loading data and using the software presented.
